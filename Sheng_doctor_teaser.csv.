# Sheng Doctor – Kenyan Swahili (Sheng) Project  

Sheng Doctor is an open project dedicated to **documenting, standardizing, and digitizing Kenyan Swahili (Sheng)** for global recognition.  

Kenyan Swahili, popularly known as **Sheng**, is a vibrant urban language born in Nairobi and spread across East Africa. It mixes Swahili, English, and local dialects — evolving daily through music, street culture, and online platforms.  

This repository provides a **teaser dataset** of Sheng words, their English meanings, and example usage.  
The **full dataset** is being curated for future use in translation software (Google Translate, Duolingo, DeepL), dictionaries, education, and cultural preservation.
